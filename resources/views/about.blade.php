                        </span>is a local food company that specializes in producing
authentic Taiwanese delicacies in the Philippines. Our products are handcrafted
using locally sourced ingredients. Established in 2017, Soystory began making authentic
Taiwanese pastries. Our objective is to promote and serve authentic Taiwanese
pastries in the Philippine market, and at the same time support Filipino
farmers by directly buying locally grown produce from them.&nbsp;<br>

in Taiwanese beverages and desserts with our Sun-Q line. We believe that food
is one of, if not, the best way to share culture. In our time, Third Culture
Kid (TCK) or people with mixed races aren’t the only ones who experience
homesickness as we have a lot of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) or students
who have pursued a career or a degree abroad like Taiwan. I once have read a
quote by Mirriam Adeney:&nbsp; &nbsp;<i></i>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                      </p>
                      <blockquote class="u-text u-text-3"> “<i>You will
never be completely at home again, because part of your heart always will be
elsewhere. That is the price you pay for the richness of loving and knowing
people in more than one place.” </i>
                      </blockquote>

we offer.&nbsp;</p>
