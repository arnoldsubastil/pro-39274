                      <p class="u-text u-text-2"> Food is the best way to share culture, and one of the main visions that Soystory has is to build a bridge between Taiwan and the Philippines. Overseas workers, international students, and people of Taiwanese descent in the Philippines all experience a degree of homesickness. Our company aims to bring one back to a cherished memory they had as they enjoy the delicious food that we offer. With the promise of providing freshness and quality, Soystory continues to bring a bite of Taiwan to customers in the Philippines.
